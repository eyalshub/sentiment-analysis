# sentiment-analysis
Initial project working with emotion analysis and creating models for understanding emotion from text from social networks GoEmotions and Sentiment140 

Sentiment Analysis and Emotion Detection
This project focuses on sentiment analysis and emotion detection using two datasets: Sentiment140 (for sentiment analysis) and GoEmotions (for emotion detection).

Project Overview
Sentiment Analysis: Classifying tweets as positive, neutral, or negative using the Sentiment140 dataset.
Emotion Detection: Detecting emotions (e.g., joy, sadness, anger) in text using the GoEmotions dataset.
Key Steps
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the Sentiment140 and GoEmotions datasets.
Model Training: Using machine learning techniques like Transformers (BERT) for classification.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of models through accuracy and confusion matrices.
Status
This project is still under development. Improvements are being made to the models, and further evaluation and optimization are ongoing.

How to Use
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-emotion-detection.git
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
To train and predict:

For sentiment analysis: python train_sentiment_model.py
For emotion detection: python train_emotion_model.py
Results
The models predict sentiment and emotions with an accuracy of X% and Y%, respectively.
