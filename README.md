# Sentiment Analysis with Transformers
This repository contains a project focused on sentiment analysis using transformer models. The goal is to classify text data into sentiment categories such as positive, negative, or neutral using pre-trained models like DistilBERT, BERT, and RoBERTa.

Note: This project is still under development and is a work in progress.

## Introduction
Sentiment analysis is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP) that aims to determine the sentiment expressed in a given text. This project leverages transformer models like DistilBERT, BERT, and RoBERTa for sentiment classification. The models are fine-tuned on a sentiment-labeled dataset to predict sentiment categories such as positive, negative, and neutral.

Note: The project is currently under active development, and ongoing improvements are being made.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need Python and several libraries installed. The required dependencies are:

torch
transformers
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
You can install these dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install torch transformers scikit-learn pandas numpy
## Data
The dataset used in this project contains text data labeled with sentiment (positive, negative, neutral). The data is split into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the model performance.

For the analysis, I have also used a dataset containing emotional data with 27 different emotion categories to classify the emotions expressed in the text.

## Models
This project uses the following transformer models:

DistilBERT: A smaller, faster version of BERT, designed for efficient performance without compromising too much on accuracy.
BERT: A powerful, widely-used transformer model that has been fine-tuned for multiple NLP tasks.
RoBERTa: A variant of BERT that is trained with more data and uses different optimization techniques.
You can experiment with different models to see which one gives the best results for your sentiment classification task.

## Training
The models are trained using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 2e-5. The training process involves optimizing the model on a sentiment-labeled dataset and fine-tuning it for classification. Training is done for a specified number of epochs, with the model's performance evaluated on a validation set.

## Evaluation
After training, the model is evaluated on a separate test set to assess its accuracy and performance. You can compute metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure the effectiveness of the trained model.

## Sentiment Analysis & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Data Preprocessing
In this project, various text preprocessing steps were performed, including tokenization, text cleaning, and handling missing values in the dataset. The goal was to ensure that the text data fed into the models was clean and properly formatted for optimal performance.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During the analysis phase, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to better understand the dataset and the distribution of sentiments/emotions. Some of the insights I gained include:

Class Distribution: Visualizing the distribution of different sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral) and emotional categories to identify class imbalances or biases.
Text Length Analysis: Analyzing the distribution of text lengths to ensure that input sequences are properly truncated and padded.
Correlations: Analyzing relationships between different sentiment categories and emotion labels to identify patterns or correlations in the data.
### Model Evaluation
Once the models were trained, I performed several evaluations to assess their performance:

Confusion Matrix: I used confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the models across different sentiment categories and emotional labels.
Classification Metrics: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were calculated to assess the quality of the modelâ€™s predictions.
### Model Comparison
I compared different transformer models, such as DistilBERT, BERT, and RoBERTa, to determine which one performed best in terms of accuracy and efficiency. I also explored the impact of fine-tuning and adjusting hyperparameters to optimize the models.

## Usage
Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict sentiment for new, unseen text. The trained model can classify text as positive, negative, or neutral based on the learned patterns from the training data.
